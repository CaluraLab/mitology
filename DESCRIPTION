Description: mitology allows to study the mitochondrial activity throught
        high-throughput RNA-seq data. It is based on a collection of genes whose
        proteins localize in to the mitochondria. From these, mitology provides 
        a reorganization of the pathways related to mitochondria activity from 
        Reactome and Gene Ontology. Further a ready-to-use implementation of 
        MitoCarta3.0 pathways is included.
